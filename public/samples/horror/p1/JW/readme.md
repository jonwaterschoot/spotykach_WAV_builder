## Sound description

A 10 minute soundscape jam with a dark uneasy mood and hints of rhythm. Uncut slightly compressed and limited (Bitwig) recording session where Synthux Simple Touch with the Audrey firmware is the main sound generator. Using its feedback and resonator to create a soundscape, making it semi rhythmic by using model cycles as a input into Audrey Touch and then recording and playing back altered loops with Spotykach.
